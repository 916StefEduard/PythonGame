# PythonGame

 Employing the layered architecture principles, the game ConnectFour between a player and a computer (using mini-max algorithm for optimization). 
 Implemented both a console-based and a GUI-based (PyGame framework) interface.
 
 ConnectFour is a two-player connection board game, in which the players choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs into a seven-column, six-row vertically     suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs.
